# Destruction
Demo for Destruction of Walls like "Rainbow 6 Siege"
For Triangulation earclipping algorithm is used..
For Connecting holes closest verts of the holes used 
Then based on connecions shape's indices generated
There is no solution for clipping existing holes or hulls edges 
I may try to solve this problem in the feature!
